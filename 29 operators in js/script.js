//Operators in js 

// operators in js are two type

//unary operator

// binary operator

// operator and operand

//in 3+4 3,4 are operands and + is operator

// example for unary operator is -9 , -10 , x=-y
// unary operator works with only one operand

// example for binary operator is 3+4 , 3/4 , 8*8 ,9-7
// binary operators works with two operands

let a = 3;
let b = 5;
let c = a + b;

console.log(c);

console.log(3 + 3);
console.log(3 - 3);
console.log(3 / 4);
console.log(3 * 3);
console.log(3 % 4);  //Modulus % gives the remainder after division
console.log(3 ** 4);  // ** gives the Exponentiation

// + , - , * , / , % , ** are called arthmetic operators and used to perform mathematical operations

let num1 = 2;
let num2 = 3;
console.log(" num1 = 2 , num2 = 3")
console.log("The value of num1+num2 is " + (num1 + num2));
console.log("The value of num1-num2 is " + (num1 - num2));
console.log("The value of num1*num2 is " + (num1 * num2));
console.log("The value of num1/num2 is " + (num1 / num2));
console.log("The value of num1%num2 is " + (num1 % num2));
console.log("The value of num1**num2 is " + (num1 ** num2));
